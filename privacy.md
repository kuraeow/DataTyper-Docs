## Overview

DataTyper is designed to work with design and content data inside Figma.

---

## Authentication and access

DataTyper uses Figma OAuth for authentication.

- DataTyper does not create or manage user passwords
- DataTyper does not store authentication secrets
- Authentication is handled entirely by Figma

The authorization token issued by Figma is stored locally inside Figma clientStorage on the user’s computer.
