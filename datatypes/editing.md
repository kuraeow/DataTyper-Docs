# Editing and Deleting Datatypes

You can edit or delete datatypes at any time.

Changes are applied immediately to the dataset.

## Editing a datatype

You can edit:

- The datatype name
- The list of values

Renaming a datatype does not affect existing values.

---

## Deleting a datatype

Deleting a datatype:

- Removes the datatype from the dataset
- Deletes all values inside it

This action cannot be undone.

Make sure the datatype is no longer needed before deleting it.
