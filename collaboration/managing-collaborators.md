## Full access for collaborators

All collaborators have full access to the dataset:

- They can edit datatypes and values
- They can import and export data
- They can fill designs using the dataset

There are no role-based permissions.

---

## Removing collaborators

As the dataset owner, you can remove collaborators at any time.

When a collaborator is removed:

- They immediately lose access to the dataset
- The dataset disappears from their list
- Their local changes are no longer synchronized

The dataset itself remains unchanged for the owner and other collaborators.
