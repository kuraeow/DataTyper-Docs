# Leaving a Shared Dataset

If you are connected to a dataset shared by another user, you can leave it at any time.

---

## How to leave a shared dataset

To disconnect from a shared dataset:

1. Select the shared dataset
2. Delete the dataset from your dataset list

This action only affects your local access.

---

## What happens after leaving

When you leave a shared dataset:

- The dataset is removed from your account
- You no longer receive updates
- You can no longer modify the data

The dataset remains available to the owner and other collaborators.

Leaving a dataset does not delete it from the owner’s storage.
