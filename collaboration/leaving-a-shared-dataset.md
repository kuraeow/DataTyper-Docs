## How to leave a shared dataset

To disconnect from a shared dataset:

1. Select the shared dataset
2. Remove the dataset from your dataset list

---

## What happens after leaving

When you leave a shared dataset:

- The dataset is removed from your account
- You no longer receive updates
- You can no longer modify the data

The dataset remains available to the owner and other collaborators.

Leaving a dataset does not delete it from the owner’s storage.
