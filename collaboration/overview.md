# Collaboration

DataTyper allows multiple users to work with the same dataset collaboratively.

Collaboration is designed around a shared single source of truth, ensuring that everyone works with the same data and sees changes in real time.

## How collaboration works

Collaboration in DataTyper is based on sharing datasets between users.

- One user shares a dataset using a shared code
- Other users connect to the dataset using this code
- All collaborators get full editing access
- All changes are stored in the dataset owner’s storage

There is no read-only mode for collaborators.

## Dataset ownership

Every dataset has an owner — the user who originally created it.

- The owner controls access
- The owner can remove collaborators
- The dataset storage always belongs to the owner

Collaborators work with the same data, but do not become owners of the dataset.
