# Filling Data

Filling data in Figma is the core functionality of DataTyper.

## On this page

- [How filling works](#how-filling-works)
- [Supported layers](#supported-layers)


It allows you to apply structured data directly to your Figma layers, eliminating manual copy-paste and making data-driven design fast and predictable.

## How filling works

DataTyper fills **only selected layers** in your Figma file.

The basic flow is:

1. Select layers in Figma
2. Choose one or more datatypes in DataTyper
3. Apply filling

Values are applied in sequence based on the selected options.

## Supported layers

Currently, DataTyper fills:

- Text layers

Other layer types are ignored during filling.
