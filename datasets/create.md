# Create a Dataset

Creating a dataset is the first step to working with data in DataTyper.

---

## How to create a dataset

1. Open the DataTyper plugin
2. Click **Create dataset**
3. Enter a name for the dataset
4. Confirm creation

The new dataset becomes active immediately.

---

## Naming datasets

Choose clear and descriptive names, especially if you plan to use multiple datasets.

Examples:
- Marketing Website Content
- Mobile App Copy
- Demo Data
- Client A – Production

Dataset names can be changed later.

---

## Automatic dataset creation

If you import a CSV file while no datasets exist, DataTyper will automatically create a new dataset and import the data into it.

This means you can start working with DataTyper directly from a CSV file if you prefer.
