## Permanent deletion

When you delete a dataset:

- All datatypes inside the dataset are deleted
- All values are deleted
- All collaboration links are removed

---

## How to delete a dataset

1. Open dataset settings
2. Select **Delete dataset**
3. Confirm the deletion

DataTyper requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

<div class="callout warning">
<strong>Warning</strong><br>
Deleting a dataset permanently removes it and all associated data. Once deleted, its datatypes and values cannot be restored.
</div>

## Impact on collaborators

If the dataset is shared:

- The dataset is removed for all collaborators
- Access is immediately revoked

Make sure no one relies on the dataset before deleting it.

<div class="callout tip">
<strong>Tip</strong><br>
If a collaborator removes a shared dataset, it's only unlinked from their workspace — the original dataset and it's data remain intact for the owner and other collaborators.
</div>

## Recommended precautions

Before deleting a dataset, consider:
- Exporting the dataset to CSV as a backup
- Confirming that the dataset is no longer needed
- Informing collaborators, if applicable
