# Delete a Dataset

Deleting a dataset permanently removes it and all associated data.

---

## Permanent deletion

When you delete a dataset:

- All datatypes inside the dataset are deleted
- All values are deleted
- All collaboration links are removed

**This action is permanent and cannot be undone.**

---

## How to delete a dataset

1. Open dataset settings
2. Select **Delete dataset**
3. Confirm the deletion

DataTyper requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

---

## Impact on collaborators

If the dataset is shared:

- The dataset is removed for all collaborators
- Access is immediately revoked

Make sure no one relies on the dataset before deleting it.

---

## Recommended precautions

Before deleting a dataset, consider:
- Exporting the dataset to CSV as a backup
- Confirming that the dataset is no longer needed
- Informing collaborators, if applicable
