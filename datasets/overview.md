# Datasets

A **Dataset** is the main container for your data in DataTyper.

Datasets allow you to organize, store, and reuse structured data across your designs.  
You can create multiple datasets for different projects, teams, or use cases.

---

## What a Dataset contains

Each dataset includes:

- Datatypes
- Values inside each datatype
- Storage source configuration
- Collaboration settings

A dataset represents a single source of truth for all connected users.

---

## Active Dataset

At any time, one dataset is marked as **active**.

The active dataset is the one used when you:
- create or edit datatypes
- import or export CSV data
- fill designs in Figma

You can switch between datasets at any time from the DataTyper interface.

---

## Number of datasets

There is **no limit** on the number of datasets you can create.

This makes it easy to:
- separate data by project
- maintain different content sets
- experiment without affecting production data
